So it was time to update the visual of this blog, as the default twenty twelve wordpress theme was starting to show its age.
I started finding it visually boring a few months ago and the fact that it is not a responsive design let me to decide that a redesign was in order.
My original idea was to just create a new responsive template using [foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), but after some research it turns out creating a wordpress there is quite an involved process.
Not only would I have to create all the theming HTML/CSS, I'd also have to integrate them in the necessary PHP code scaffolding.
As most tasks that require a significant time investment, I put this off indefinitely.

Luckily a few weeks back with a new wordpress came a new default theme, twenty thirteen.
This is a nice responsive theme which places visual emphasis on the actual posts with larger fonts and no cumbersome sidebar (all that stuff is now in the footer, which is a great idea).
This meant I only had to edit the CSS to get something which fulfills my requirements and has at least some identity.

The process started by creating a [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes). Since I am quite happy with the base layout, all I needed to do was to edit the colors to my heart's content.
Like all color challenged engineers I had to resort to some cheating.
The usual place to cheat is to pick a pallete from [colourlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/); but I find it is still an overwhelming experience.
There is still simply too much to choose from.
What I need is a very constrained set of good looking colors.
To the rescue: [flatUI colors](http://flatuicolors.com/).
I picked the midnight blue as the main color for the header as a nod to the visual design my homepage had during my teenage years ([nostalgia time](http://www.nehalemlabs.net/labs/)).
Then I desaturated it for the other blues I needed.
For some contrasty accents, I went with the alizarin, which is also a pretty cool name for a color.
Here is the pallete I built:

<div style="float: left;">
  <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #e74c3c;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="color: #333333; font-size: 0.8em;">
    Alizarin
  </div>
</div>

<div style="float: left;">
  <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #2c3e50;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="color: #333333; font-size: 0.8em;">
    Midnight blue
  </div>
</div>

<div style="float: left;">
  <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #2980b9;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="color: #333333; font-size: 0.8em;">
    Random blue #1
  </div>
</div>

<div style="float: left;">
  <div style="width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: #a1c7ea;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="color: #333333; font-size: 0.8em;">
    Random blue #2
  </div>
</div>

<div style="clear: both;">
</div>

Even though a real graphic designer is probably appalled by these choices, I'm pretty proud of how the visuals turned out.
I have recently started paying more attention to design, which I think is an often overlooked area by scientists and engineers.
It is already hard enough to communicate our work to a wide audience  and boring designs aren't helping one bit.
