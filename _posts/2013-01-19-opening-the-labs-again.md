After a few weeks musing over what to do with this old domain I decided this should be a place to keep a decent weblog.
Since lately I've been boiling over with half complete ideas and projects perhaps it will be helpful to write them down with some structure.

As usual the hardest part about creating an internet presence is devising a witty name.
Having started with the inspiring name of 'blog', I settled on prototype.
Seemingly a fitting description for most of my projects, past and future.
