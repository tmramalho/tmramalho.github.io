Hi, I'm Tiago and I am running [Recursive](https://recursiveai.co.jp/en) in Tokyo.
We are focused on building AI tools to improve companies' sustainability impact.
Take a look at our website to learn more, or reach out to me directly if you
are passionate about the intersection of technology and sustainability.

Originally a physicist, I used to work at Google Deepmind as a Research Engineering
Manager, and then moved to Tokyo to work at Cogent Labs, a startup working on
enterprise solutions for AI.
